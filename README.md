DATA IS THE NEW OIL Oracle is the better

CLOUD COMPUTING - is the delivery of computing services wherein they provide servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the internet ("the cloud") for faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
On-demand delivery
Pay-as-you-go model
Provision only the size you need(exactly right type and size)
Access resources instantly



BENEFITS OF CLOUD

Faster time to market - Instead of investing funds in creating a new data structure, the org relies on clouds like AWS and utilises these funds in their business.

Scalability and flexibility - cloud offers an unlimited amount of virtual resources

Cost savings

Better collaboration - teams can still collaborate in different geographical regions.

Advanced security - cloud ensures data security.

Data loss prevention - customers cant lose their data in S3.


DISADVANTAGES OF CLOUD

Risk of vendor lock-in- it's impossible for the organisation to move from one cloud to another.

Less control over underlying cloud infrastructure - If a company wants more control of their compliance(at the under-neath layer), then it must refrain from using the cloud.

Concerns about security risks like data privacy and online threats

Integration complexity with existing systems

Unforeseen costs and unexpected expenses.

PUBLIC CLOUD v/s PRIVATE CLOUD -

Public Cloud	Private Cloud
a. Hosted at service provider site.	a. Hosted at Enterprise or Service Provider site.
b. Supports connectivity over the Internet.	b. Supports connectivity over internet/private network(WAN)
c. Suitable for information not very sensitive.	c. Suitable for very sensitive information
d. Cheaper than Private cloud.	d. Costlier than the public cloud.
e. Utilises shared infrastrucure.	e. Doesn't utilise shared infrastructure.
f. Supports multiple customers.	f. Supports one customer.
g. Requires high-level of security	g. Requires medium-level security.
h. May use VLANs, access list, VRF file, MPLs to logic	
i. Eg: Open Nebula	i. Eg: Eucalyptus

7. SERVICE MODELS

Elastic Beanstalk, Zoho cloud, Salesforce - software service provider.


AMAZON WEB SERVICES (AWS)

Offers 200 fully featured services

COMPUTE SERVICES

Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) - manage scanning of both EC2 and ECS

Elastic Container Service (ECS) - provides containers

Lambda - Serverless - to make a database architecture serverless.


STORAGE SERVICES

Simple Storage Service (S3) - is an object storage which means it is already pre-formatted and doesn't allow formatting at a later stage. Storage is k/a buckets. can put necessary authentication, passwords, and authorization.

Elastic Block Store (EBS) - that storage which can be formatted at any point of time and is generally which are attached to an OS. Provides volume which can be attached to our EC@ instances.

Elastic File System (EFS) - is a shared file system which is used in BRDB solutions (multiple clients working on a single desk i.e. database.) can be used in logging instances. Provides seamless storage.

Archival Service - Glacier - AWS Glacier provides cheapest storage where data is not used regularly.

RAID 5(Redundant Array of Independent Disks) - data is sliced in 3 disks. 1disk - 1, 5,9,10 2disk - 2, 6,7 3disk - 3,4,8. If 1 disk is damaged, still it can be recovered. are done on hardware.


NETWORK SERVICES
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) - Internal network.

Domain Name Service - Route 53

Direct Connect - Direct Connect(costliest service) is a service provided by AWS where they connect your data centre to AWS through a wired connection.


S3
S3
Object Storage with durability of 99.99999%, 11 9's
Infinitely scaling storage
Can keep files in buckets
S3 is a global service but buckets are created in specific regions
Globally unique bucket names.
Durability - 11 9's durability = if 1,00,00,000 objects are stored, avg incurred loss of a single object once every 10,000 years.

S3 standard has 99.99% availabilty = not available 53 minutes a year.

SECURITY

User based - IAM policies

Resource based

Bucket policies
Bucket ACLs
Object ACLs
Public vs Private accessible Buckets

Object versioning

State-of-the-art in transit and at-rest encryption

STORAGE CLASSES image


EC2

Most popular AWS offering
Infrastructure as a code service
Provides rented Virtual machines
EC2 uses EBS and instance store to store data
EC2 uses ELB to ditribute data
EC2 uses autoscaling for scaling purposes
Bootstrapping can be done using userdata scripts.
Instance store vs EBS |---|---| |a. Fastest storage.|| |b. Once shut, data is wiped off.||

EC2 Instance Type a. C-type instances - CPU intensive which provides more CPU b. M-type instances - General purpose instances which have balanced memory and CPU c. R-type instances - which has more RAM d. T-type instances

EC2

Security Groups- short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second

Reserved (1 and 3 years)

Reserved instances - a commitment to an account of usage, long workload, 1 and 3 years upfront commitment, can save up to 72% of billing.

Spot Instances - short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)

Dedicated hosts - book an entire physical server, control instance placement, most expensive EC2, use case - BYOL, compliance or regulations.

Dedicated instances - no other customers will share your hardware.

ELASTIC LOAD BALANCERS (ELB)

Implementation of Horizontal Scaling
Required for High availability
Types of load balancers
Classic Load Balancer - Layer 4 and 7. works as a reverse proxy. Can do virtual hosting based on port number
Application Load Balancer - Layer 7. Certain things like virtual hosting based on path can only work in layer 7. Eg: Apache Web Server.
Network Load Balancer - Layer 4
AUTOSCALING

Self-healing Implementation for dynamic loads.
Can create and terminate instances automatically
Manual scaling: update the size of an ASG manually
Dynamic Scaling: Respond to changing demand
Simple/Step scaling
When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (eg CPU>70%), then add 2 units
When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (Eg CPU<30%), then remove 1
SIMPLE/STEP SCALING
To keep avg ASG CPU around 40% -Scheduled scaling
Anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns
As scheduled patterns
